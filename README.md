# The Role of Quenched Variability in Enhancing Memory Storage in Neuronal Networks

This repository contains the code and resources for my Bachelor's thesis in Mathematics at VU University Amsterdam.

## Abstract

This project explores how quenched variability affects memory storage capacity in recurrent neural networks with Behavioral Time-Scale Plasticity (BTSP). We investigate the trade-off between enhanced memory capacity and memory bias using analytical and numerical methods, focusing on a ring model approximation of the network dynamics.

## Key Features

1. Implementation of a ring model for neural network dynamics
2. Analysis of steady-state solutions and stability conditions
3. Fourier analysis of quenched variability in network connectivity
4. Numerical simulations of bump formation and stability
5. Investigation of hotspots in the network

## Interactive Simulations

Several interactive Jupyter notebooks are provided to explore:
- Bifurcation diagrams for different parameter values
- Effects of quenched variability on network dynamics
- Formation and properties of bump attractors
